At the system level, this step encompases 

## Tasks

### Organization-Level Tasks
These tasks are completed at the organization level, which results in output (e.g., organization baselines) that are used at the system level.

**P-1 - Risk Management Roles:**

**P-2 - Risk Management Strategy:** 

**P-3 - Risk Assessment--Organization:** 

**P-4 - Organizationally-Tailored Control Baselines and Cybersecurity Framework Profiles (optional):** 

**P-5 - Common Control Identification:** 

**P-6 - Impact-Level Prioritization (optional):** 

**P-7 - Continuous Monitoring Strategy--Organization:**

### System-Level Tasks

**P-8 - Mission or Business Focus:** Document the missions, business functions, and processes the system will support.

**P-9 - System Stakeholders:** Identify stakeholders with an interest in the success of the system, covering the development, operation, and maintenance of the system.

**P-10 - Asset Identification:** Enumerate assets (systems, hardware, software)

**P-11 - Authorization Boundary:** Establish the scope of the system, responsibilities, and protections.

**P-12 - Information Types:** The types of information processed, stored, and transmitted by the system are identified.

**P-13 - Information Life Cycle:** All stages of the information life cycle are identified and understood for each information type processed, stored, or transmitted by the system.

**P-14 - Risk Assessment--System:** A system-level risk assessment is completed or updated. Identify threat sources, threat events affecting assets, vulnerabilities to threats, likelihood of vulnerability exploitation by threats, and impact of loss of the asset. A privacy risk assessment should be conducted if the system processes PII. A supply chain risk assessment should also be conducted.

**P-15 - Requirements Definition:** Security and privacy requirements are defined and prioritized.

**P-16 - Enterprise Architecture:** Determine the system's placement within the enterprise architecture.

**P-17 - Requirements Allocation:** Security and privacy requirements are allocated to the system and environment.

**P-18 - System Registration:** The system is registered for purposes of management, accountability, coordination, and oversight.
